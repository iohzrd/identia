## Development / Running from source

Follow [this guide](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) to setup dev dependencies...

### Install Protobuf

Install the latest version of protobuf from the Github [releases page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases). The latest version at the time of writing is v22.3.

### Linux

For video playback on linux, you may need to manually install gstreamer/gst-plugins:
`gstreamer gst-libva gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-ugly`

For hardware video acceleration install: `gstreamer-vaapi`. Optional but recommended.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Architecture

### The identity object:

```
{
    "avatar": "", // base64 encoded image or ipfs CID for "avatar"
    "description": "", // user-defined description / bio
    "display_name": "", // user-defined display name
    "following": [""], // a list of ID's the user follows
    "meta": {}, // graph time!
    "posts": [""], // a list of CIDs that represent post objects
    "publisher": "", // users IPNS ID
    "timestamp": 1608271880058, // UTC adjusted UNIX timestamp of the identities last alteration
}
```

### The post object:

```
{
    "body": "", // the text body of the post
    "files": [], // a list of file paths, relative to the post root
    "meta": {}, // graph time!
    "publisher": "", // original publisher, will be used for "re-post" functionality
    "timestamp": 1608271880058 // UTC adjusted UNIX timestamp of the post
}
```

### The meta object:

```
{"TODO": "so many things to do..."}
```

The meta object is a store for arbitrary data that can be used to describe complex relationships between various types of data.
These relationships can be stored in a post object to add context to a specific post or in the identity object to provide an identity-wide context scope.
